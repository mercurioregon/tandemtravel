## Requirements/Dependencies
Node.js, Apollo, Mongoose, Cors, Vite, Bcrypt, Socket.io, HarperDB, FullCalendar

## Features
TandemTravel is an all-in-one app.  Users create an account and log in with a username and password. They can invite others to events that are created on the Events tab. The Events tab leads to the Event List.  There, users will find a list of current list of events on their schedule and the ability to create new events. Clicking on the event reveals a description of the event.  

Huddle is a calendar feature where users and their invited guests can see upcoming events and make adjustments as necessary. TravelChat is a way for them to leave messages to one another in up to four chat rooms.


## Future Development
 While this project is under development.

TandemTravel is an app designed for groups to plan events together and synchronize their travel details in real time.

In the near future options for TandemTravel will offer a fully integrated group calendar, chat, and travel resources and the ability to coordinate and purchase tickets for entertainment venues, theme parks, and even restaurants reservations.

### Tandem Travel will be a one stop spot to get your friends and family together.
